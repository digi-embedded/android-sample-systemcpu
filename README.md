System Management - CPU Sample Application
=========================================

This application demonstrates the usage of the System Management - CPU and
memory APIs. It displays some panels to configure the CPU cores and settings and
monitoring some of the CPU and memory parameters.

Demo requirements
-----------------

To run this example you need:

* A compatible development board to host the application.
* A USB connection between the board and the host PC in order to transfer and
  launch the application.

Demo setup
----------

Make sure the hardware is set up correctly:

1. The development board is powered on.
2. The board is connected directly to the PC by the micro USB cable.

Demo run
--------

The example is already configured, so all you need to do now is to build and
launch the project.

While it is running, the application displays a set of panels. Each panel
displays specific functionality provided by the API:

  * CPU cores: Allows you to enable and disable the different CPU cores.
  * CPU configuration: Allows you to configure the CPU frequencies and
                       governor. Depending on the selected governor, you can
                       configure advanced governor settings.
  * CPU usage: Displays the overall usage of the CPU in % as well as the
               usage of each core.
  * PI calculation test: Executes an arithmetic test calculating the
                         specified digits of the number Pi.
  * CPU and memory status: Displays instant values of some CPU and memory
                           parameters such as temperature, overall usage,
                           current frequency, and free vs total memory.
